# Work Day Scheduler App

An application for scheduling ones workday. Created with jQuery, Bootstrap, localStorage, and Moment.js.

Users can plan their workday by viewing a 9-5 schedule with hour blocks where they can write down what they will be doing. During the day, the background color of the time blocks on the schedule will change to alert the user whether the time/event has passed, is happening now, or is upcoming. Users can save changes they make to the schedule by clicking on the save button on the right hand side of each time block.
